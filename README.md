# FLAG Orientation 

The national ag holds signifcant cultural and symbolic importance or a nation. It serves asa powerul emblem that embodies the history, values, unity o a country via evoking a sense o patriotism and pride. Flags are more than mere pieces o cloth; they are visual representationso a nation’s identity.During aerial maneuvers, UAV or drones have to position themselves by controlling tilt andheight. Experimental robotics use ArUco markers (you can consider them as QR codes) whichare placed on the grounds or adjusting their position. However, fxed size visual patterns can beused in remote terrain or drone positioning. Indian ag serves as a good localizer by militarydrones. At the current non-optimal position, drone sees the image as shown in ‘input’, then itadjusts its position (tilt and height) continuously with minimum movement till it sees the fnal‘reerence’ image. Note there is no need o rotation along Z-(height)-axis (yaw). Your task is togenerate the ‘reference’ image or the input seen by drone.
Your function should take input as an image array and it should return the output as animage array. Here input size may vary but each reerence image is having a size 600x600 pixels,radius o circle = 100, center o circle is (300,300), circle width = 2 and spoke width = 1 pixel. Youwill be given the python program, where you have to complete the unction while returning theproper reerence image or each input image. There will be 10 to 20 test cases used or automaticevaluation o your program. Think about all corner cases.
